# RNG Standardization

## Explanation
For a fair and competitive nature, MCSR Ranked standardizes some RNG (Random Number Generation) through the **RNG Seed**. As a result, all players in the match will experience the same loot rates in the same order.

The RNG Seed is same as Overworld seed by default. In private room, you can use a different RNG Seed.

This document will describe what is standardized based on RNG Seed.

## Piglin Barters
- Barter chances for Obsidian are increased by ~35%
- At least 6 Obsidian is guaranteed every 72 barters (8 Gold Blocks)
- Exactly 3 Ender Pearl trades are guaranteed every 72 barters (8 Gold Blocks)
- All players in the match have the same trades in the same order

## Entity Drop Loot
- Blaze Rod rates from Blazes are standardized
- Ender Pearl rates from Endermen are standardized
- Iron Golems always drop 4 Iron (never 3 or 5)
- Food drops from animals and Hoglins are standardized

## Block Drop Loot
- Flint rates from Gravel are standardized
- Sticks rates from Dead Bushes are standardized
- Apples rates from Leaves are standardized

## Item Usage
- Eye of Ender throw break rates are standardized
  - Also, the 2nd eye throw will never break
- Hunger effect rates from Rotten Flesh is standardized
- Effects from Suspicious Stew are standardized
  - Also, Suspicious Stew can never give Poison
- Endermite spawn rates from Ender Pearl throw is standardized per dimension
- Wool rates from shearing sheep are standardized

## Ender Dragon
- The sequence of target block height offsets is standardized within each phase
  - The target block height offset for zero cycles is 0-15 blocks, as opposed to the 0-20 in vanilla
- Direction changes are standardized within each phase
- Strafes are standardized
- Perches are standardized
  ::: details Strafe/perch standardization details
  When the dragon spawns and after each strafe, a standardized random number between 0 and 1 is chosen. The dragon strafes when the cumulative probability of having not yet strafed drops below the random number.

  Perch standardization is similar, however the dragon also perches if the cumulative probability of having not yet perched drops below 0.1.

## Mob Spawners
- Blaze spawning timings are standardized
- Blaze spawning positions in spawners are standardized
::: details Details about Spawner standardization logic
The mod tries to attempt up to 4 spots in the spawner. These 4 spots are the same for both runners no matter which spawner. If any fire, block, entity or yourself is blocking the spot, you will NOT get that blaze. The time for these 4 spots to be chosen is the same, and thus this is why the blaze x,y,z are exactly the same as well. The 4 spots the mod tries to spawn are vanilla style, so it will have a large chance closer to the center of spawner.
:::
- Magma Cube spawning positions and sizes are standardized

## Mob Behavior
- Monsters do not spawn in Bastion Remnants except built-in entities
- Monsters do not spawn in Desert Temples
- Zombified Piglins avoid pathfinding into Bastion Remnants
- Ghasts do not spawn within 5 chunks of the player
- Drowned never spawn with a held Trident
- Elder Guardians never afflict the player with Mining Fatigue
- Phantoms spawn and cycle is standardized
- Rain/storm cycle is standardized
- Villager trade offers are standardized

## Player & Portal Behaviors
- Player spawn coordinates are standardized
- Initial Nether entry location is standardized by spawn coordinates. The Y level behaviour is standardized to 64.
::: details
Every portal is treated like you are building on Y64 in the overworld, however this does not guarantee Y64 in the Nether. If the Nether is buried from Y64-Y31, then your portal will be Y30. Regardless, the portal is standardized for X,Y,Z.
:::
- First blind portal* will always spawn on the surface if built at Nether Y level 48 or above, so you rarely get caved.

*: First portal from Nether for travel to Stronghold.
